KnowYourDNA provides a direct-to-consumer genetic testing service in which customers provide a saliva sample that is laboratory analyzed. It helps people access and understand their genome better by offering advanced DNA reports that deliver:
●	An enriching view of a person’s ancestry that helps discover their family history.
●	In-depth information about genetic predispositions to health risks, wellness, and physical traits.

Created an end-to-end product prototype including business needs, requirements, data flow, structural diagrams and the graphical user interface of the system. 
This would help people access and understand the genome by DNA reports. 
This application also has a feature where the customer can interact with the physician through the system.
